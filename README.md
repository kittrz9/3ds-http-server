# 3DS HTTP Server

this (attempts to) run a web server that sends the files in the romfs folder<br>
all of this is basically the romfs and sockets examples just kinda glued together into something that barely works lmao (the makefile is from the romfs example)<br>
it also slows down a ton when sending the gif, it seems like it freezes but after a while it starts uploading again and finishes<br>
